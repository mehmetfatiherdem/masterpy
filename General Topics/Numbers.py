### Numbers in Python ###

## integer
x = 5
x = -3

## float
x = 5.2
x = -4.9

### you can declare float also as scientific numbers e/E (2e3 => 2x10^3 => 2000.0)
x = 2e3
x = 4E5
x = -91.5e100 # -9.15e+101

## complex
x = 5 + 5j
x = 2j

### you can print the type of a variable with type()
print(type(x))


### you can do type conversion with int(), float(), and complex()
a = 2
b = 3.8
c = 4j # you cannot convert a complex number into another type!!

float(a) # int to float => 2.0
int(b) # float to int => 3 (rounds down)
